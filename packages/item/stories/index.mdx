# Item

This shows all the info users are actually after.

## List View

In the list view only the most important information is shown

- Name
- Version
- Description
- Highlight known libraries (like lit-element, haunted, stencil, ...)
- Download Time (how much time it will take to download it on 3G)
- Gzipped Size in kB
- Github stars

With this, we hope to give you all the information you need to decide which web component
look like a good fit for your use case. For each of those, you will hopefully explore the details.

#### Single item

#### Multiple items

In most cases you will see multiple items after each other.

## Detail View

Here we are adding more information.

#### Readme

This renders the README.md in the root of the package.

#### Demo

The demo is a very important part of every web component.
By default, if we find a `demo/index.html` file we will show it via unpkg.com with the module flag.
We do NOT do any magic on it. e.g. you will need to make sure it works directly via unpkg.
This usually needs to use imports directly from unpkg.

So if you wanna show demos with using properties you can do it like so.

```html
<div id="demo"></div>

<script type="module">
  import { html, render } from 'https://unpkg.com/lit-html?module';
  import '../test-wc-card.js';

  const title = 'test';
  render(
    html`
      <my-el .header=${title}></my-el>
    `,
    document.querySelector('#demo'),
  );
</script>
```

In case you wanna share the same demo with multiple packages you can set a `demoUrl` in your `package.json`.
This demo url will take precedence over the default url.

```js
// package.json
{
  "demoUrl": "http://this-is-my-demo-2.0.1.domain.com"
}
```

Note that this means that you will need to use versioning yourself if you wish to have different demos for different versions.

If your demo becomes big you can also publish it as a separate npm package and link it with a demoUrl.
For example you want to published `@lib/my-button@1.2.2` then you could publish `@lib-demos/my-button@1.2.2`.
So setting the `demoUrl` on `@lib/my-button` to `https://unpkg.com/@lib-demos/my-button@1.2.2/index.html?module` will give you versioned
demos without adding weight to your source package.

Be sure to NOT have a `custom-element.json` in `@lib-demos` as you don't want to have this package indexed in the catalog.

Ok finally let's look at an actual demo
